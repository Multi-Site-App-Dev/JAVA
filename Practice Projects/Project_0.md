# Project 0

## Description

Your first project should demonstrate your knowledge of the following topics: 
 - Java
 - SQL
 - JDBC
 - Basic Data Structures
 - Basic File I/O

You will be building a console application that persists data in a database with at least 2 tables which adhere to 3rd normal form (3NF). 
  

### Minimum Requirements
- Validation (malformed emails)
- Exception handling
- Documentation
- Custom data structures (self-made ArrayList)
- SQL Data Persistance (Users_Table, Card_Collection_Table)

### Bonus Features
- Unit tests for service-layer classes
- Logging messages and exceptions to a file
- Card_Table for all existing cards in the game.
- User adds cards via fuzzy search, so they don't have to type the full name most of the time.


##  User Stories
These are user stories to describe the banking app. If you are not building the banking app for your project, you will need to discuss with your trainer to establish proper user stories.

### Minimum Viable Product
### User Stories
- As a user, I can register for an account.
- As a user, I can login to my account.
- As a user, I can create an account.
- As a user, I can add a card to my collection.
- As a user, I can remove a card from my collection.
- As a user, I can display all of the cards in my collection.
- As a user, I can upload a txt file of cards and add them all to my collection.

### Bonus Stories
- As a user, I can view details on an individual card.
- As a user, I can trade with other users.


## Tech Stack
You should be employing the following technologies in your project.
 - Java 8
 - Apache Maven ( or the Dependency Manager of your choice )
 - MariaDB deployed on AWS RDS (or hosted locally on your preferred DB)


 - Your work **MUST BE YOUR OWN**. Collaboration is allowed and encouraged, but at the end of the project you must have an excellent understanding of every line of code in your project and be able to answer questions about any part of it.
