# What is Java?

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented, programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
 - **high level** - No direct memory management, abstracted away from hardware
 - **class based** - Everything written is inside a class, inheritance based on class
 - **object oriented** - Bundle data and behavior into a single logical unit, the class. (Encapsulation)
